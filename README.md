# This is a pet project to try new shiny things from the android world âœ¨

At the moment, we're loading a fixed set of elements from the Nasa API and showing the item detail with the title and the video.
I already implemented the PiP mode to watch the video even if the app is in the foreground.

# At the moment we're using the following stack
1. Single Activity Architecture with Navigation Component
2. MVVM with coroutines, migrating to Kotlin Flow Soon.
3. Kotlin Serialization
4. Multimodule App
5. Koin
6. Either from the Arrow library.

# Roadmap
1. Implement the capability of downloading videos.
2. Dark mode toggle from Settings.
3. Implement Flow.
4. Implement Hilt.
5. Implement more Arrow library features.
